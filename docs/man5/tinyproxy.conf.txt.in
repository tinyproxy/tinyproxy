=head1 NAME

tinyproxy.conf - Tinyproxy HTTP proxy daemon configuration file


=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<tinyproxy.conf>


=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<tinyproxy(8)> reads its configuration file, typically stored in
`/etc/tinyproxy/tinyproxy.conf` (or passed to Tinyproxy with -c on the
command line). This manpage describes the syntax and contents of the
configuration file.

The Tinyproxy configuration file contains key-value pairs, one per
line. Lines starting with `#` and empty lines are comments and are
ignored. Keywords are case-insensitive, whereas values are
case-sensitive. Some string values must be enclosed in double
quotes (") as noted below.

The possible keywords and their descriptions are as follows:

=over 4

=item B<User>

The user which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
initial port-binding has been done as the `root` user. Either the
user name or the UID may be specified.

=item B<Group>

The group which the Tinyproxy process should run as, after the
initial port-binding has been done as the `root` user. Either the
group name or the GID may be specified.

=item B<Port>

The port which the Tinyproxy service will listen on. If the port is
less than 1024, you will need to start the Tinyproxy process as the
`root` user.

=item B<Listen>

By default, Tinyproxy listens for connections on all available
interfaces (i.e. it listens on the wildcard address `0.0.0.0`).
With this configuration parameter, Tinyproxy can be told to listen
only on one specific address.

=item B<Bind>

This allows you to specify which address Tinyproxy will bind
to for outgoing connections.
This parameter may be specified multiple times, then Tinyproxy
will try all the specified addresses in order.

=item B<BindSame>

If this boolean parameter is set to `yes`, then Tinyproxy will
bind the outgoing connection to the IP address of the incoming
connection that triggered the outgoing request.

=item B<Timeout>

The maximum number of seconds of inactivity a connection is
allowed to have before it is closed by Tinyproxy.

=item B<ErrorFile>

This parameter controls which HTML file Tinyproxy returns when a
given HTTP error occurs. It takes two arguments, the error number
and the location of the HTML error file. Enclose the file location
in double quotes.

=item B<DefaultErrorFile>

The HTML template file returned when an error occurs for which no
specific error file has been set. Enclose in double quotes.

=item B<StatHost>

The host name or IP address that is treated as the `stat host`.
Enclose in double quotes. Whenever Tinyproxy receives a request for
the `stat host` it returns an internal statistics page instead of
forwarding the request to that host. The template for this page can be
configured with the `StatFile` configuration option. The default value
of `StatHost` is `@TINYPROXY_STATHOST@`.

=item B<StatFile>

The HTML file that Tinyproxy sends in response to a request for the
`stat host`. Enclose in double quotes. If this parameter is not set,
Tinyproxy returns a hard-coded basic statistics page. See the STATHOST
section in the L<tinyproxy(8)> manual page for details.

Note that the StatFile and the error files configured with ErrorFile
and DefaultErrorFile are template files that can contain a few
template variables that Tinyproxy expands prior to delivery.
Examples are "{cause}" for an abbreviated error description and
"{detail}" for a detailed error message.  The L<tinyproxy(8)>
manual page contains a description of all template variables.

=item B<LogFile>

The location of the file to which Tinyproxy writes its debug output.
Enclose in double quotes. Alternatively, Tinyproxy can log to syslog
-- see the Syslog option.

=item B<Syslog>

When set to `On`, this option tells Tinyproxy to write its
debug messages to syslog instead of to a log file configured
with `LogFile`. These two options are mutually exclusive.

=item B<LogLevel>

Sets the log level. Messages from the set level and above are
logged. For example, if the LogLevel was set to Warning, then all
log messages from Warning to Critical would be output, but Notice
and below would be suppressed. Allowed values are:

=over 4

=item * Critical (least verbose)

=item * Error

=item * Warning

=item * Notice

=item * Connect (log connections without Info's noise)

=item * Info (most verbose)

=back

=item B<PidFile>

The location of the file where the main Tinyproxy process stores its
process ID for signaling purposes. Enclose in double quotes.

=item B<XTinyproxy>

Setting this option to `Yes` tells Tinyproxy to add a header
`X-Tinyproxy` containing the client's IP address to the request.

=item B<Upstream>

This option allows you to set up a set of rules for deciding
whether an upstream proxy server is to be used, based on the
host or domain of the site being accessed. The rules are stored
in the order encountered in the configuration file and the
LAST matching rule wins. The following forms for specifying upstream
rules exist:

=over 4

=item * I<upstream type host:port> turns proxy upstream support on generally.

=item * I<upstream type user:pass@host:port>
does the same, but uses the supplied credentials for authentication.

=item * I<upstream type host:port "site_spec">
turns on the upstream proxy for the sites matching `site_spec`.

`type` can be one of `http`, `socks4`, `socks5`, `none`.

=item * I<upstream none "site_spec">
turns off upstream support for sites matching `site_spec`, that means the
connection is done directly.

=back

It's recommended to use raw IP addresses to specify the upstream host, so
no costly DNS lookup has to be done everytime it is used.
IPv6 addresses need to be enclosed in square brackets.

The site can be specified in various forms as a hostname, domain
name or as an IP range:

=over 4

=item * I<name>     matches host exactly

=item * I<.name>    matches any host in domain "name"

=item * I<.>        matches any host with no domain (in 'empty' domain)

=item * I<IP/bits>  matches network/mask

=item * I<IP/mask>  matches network/mask

=back

Note that the upstream directive can also be used to null-route
a specific target domain/host, e.g.:
`upstream http 0.0.0.0:0 ".adserver.com"`

=item B<MaxClients>

Tinyproxy creates one thread for each connected client.
This options specifies the absolute highest number processes that
will be created. With other words, only MaxClients clients can be
connected to Tinyproxy simultaneously.

=item B<Allow>

=item B<Deny>

The `Allow` and `Deny` options provide a means to customize
which clients are allowed to access Tinyproxy. `Allow` and `Deny`
lines can be specified multiple times to build the access control
list for Tinyproxy. The order in the config file is important.
If there are no `Allow` or `Deny` lines, then all clients are
allowed. Otherwise, the default action is to deny access.
The argument to `Allow` or `Deny` can be a single IP address
of a client host, like `127.0.0.1`, an IP address range, like
`192.168.0.1/24` or a string that will be matched against the
end of the client host name, i.e, this can be a full host name
like `host.example.com` or a domain name like `.example.com` or
even a top level domain name like `.com`.
Note that by adding a rule using a host or domain name, a costly name
lookup has to be done for every new connection, which could slow down
the service considerably.

=item B<BasicAuth>

Configure HTTP "Basic Authentication" username and password
for accessing the proxy.  If there are any entries specified,
access is only granted for authenticated users.

    BasicAuth user password

=item B<BasicAuthRealm>

In case "BasicAuth" is configured, the "realm" information.
"Proxy Authentication Required" status http 407 "error-response" can be
customized.

- defaults in code to "Tinyproxy" (PACKAGE_NAME), if not configured.

=item B<AddHeader>

Configure one or more HTTP request headers to be added to outgoing
HTTP requests that Tinyproxy makes. Note that this option will not
work for HTTPS traffic, as Tinyproxy has no control over what
headers are exchanged.

    AddHeader "X-My-Header" "Powered by Tinyproxy"

=item B<ViaProxyName>

RFC 2616 requires proxies to add a `Via` header to the HTTP
requests, but using the real host name can be a security
concern. If the `ViaProxyname` option is present, then its
string value will be used as the host name in the Via header.
Otherwise, the server's host name will be used. Enclose in double
quotes.

=item B<DisableViaHeader>

When this is set to yes, Tinyproxy does NOT add the `Via` header
to the requests. This virtually puts Tinyproxy into stealth mode.
Note that RFC 2616 requires proxies to set the `Via` header, so by
enabling this option, you break compliance.
Don't disable the `Via` header unless you know what you are doing...

=item B<Filter>

Tinyproxy supports filtering of web sites based on URLs or
domains. This option specifies the location of the file
containing the filter rules, one rule per line.

Rules are specified as POSIX basic regular expressions (BRE), unless
another FilterType is specified.
Comment lines start with a `#` character.

Example filter file contents:

 # filter exactly cnn.com
 ^cnn\.com$
 
 # filter all subdomains of cnn.com, but not cnn.com itself
 .*\.cnn.com$
 
 # filter any domain that has cnn.com in it, like xcnn.comfy.org
 cnn\.com
 
 # filter any domain that ends in cnn.com
 cnn\.com$
 
 # filter any domain that starts with adserver
 ^adserver

=item B<FilterType>

This option can be set to one of `bre`, `ere`, or `fnmatch`.
If `bre` is set, the rules specified in the filter file are matched
using POSIX basic regular expressions, when set to `ere`, using
POSIX extended regular expressions, and when set to `fnmatch` using
the `fnmatch` function as specified in the manpage `man 3p fnmatch`.
`fnmatch` matching is identical to what's used in the shell to match
filenames, so for example `*.google.com` matches everything that
ends with `.google.com`.
If you don't know what regular expressions are or you're using filter
lists from 3rd party sources, `fnmatch` is probably what you want.
It's also the fastest matching method of the three.

=item B<FilterURLs>

If this boolean option is set to `Yes` or `On`, filtering is
performed for URLs rather than for domains. The default is to
filter based on domains.

Note that filtering for URLs works only in plain HTTP scenarios.
Since HTTPS has become ubiquitous during the last years, this
will only work on a tiny fraction of websites, so it is
recommended not to use this option.

=item B<FilterExtended>

Deprecated. Use `FilterType ere` instead.
If this boolean option is set to `Yes`, then extended POSIX
regular expressions are used for matching the filter rules.
The default is to use basic POSIX regular expressions.

=item B<FilterCaseSensitive>

If this boolean option is set to `Yes`, then the filter rules
are matched in a case sensitive manner. The default is to
match case-insensitively, unfortunately.
If you set this to `Yes`, then your matching will be almost
twice as fast.
This setting affects only `bre` and `ere` FilterTypes, fnmatch
is always case sensitive.

=item B<FilterDefaultDeny>

The default filtering policy is to allow everything that is
not matched by a filtering rule. Setting `FilterDefaultDeny`
to `Yes` changes the policy do deny everything but the domains
or URLs matched by the filtering rules.
In other words, if set to `No` the Filter list acts as a
blacklist, if set to `Yes` as a whitelist.

=item B<Anonymous>

If an `Anonymous` keyword is present, then anonymous proxying
is enabled.  The headers listed with `Anonymous` are allowed
through, while all others are denied. If no Anonymous keyword
is present, then all headers are allowed through.  You must
include double quotes around the headers.

Most sites require cookies to be enabled for them to work correctly, so
you will need to allow cookies through if you access those sites.

Example:

    Anonymous "Host"
    Anonymous "Authorization"
    Anonymous "Cookie"

=item B<ConnectPort>

This option can be used to specify the ports allowed for the
CONNECT method. If no `ConnectPort` line is found, then all
ports are allowed. To disable CONNECT altogether, include a
single ConnectPort line with a value of `0`.

=item B<ReversePath>

Configure one or more ReversePath directives to enable reverse proxy
support. With reverse proxying it's possible to make a number of
sites appear as if they were part of a single site.

If you uncomment the following two directives and run Tinyproxy
on your own computer at port 8888, you can access example.com,
using http://localhost:8888/example/.

    ReversePath "/example/" "http://www.example.com/"

=item B<ReverseOnly>

When using Tinyproxy as a reverse proxy, it is STRONGLY
recommended that the normal proxy is turned off by setting
this boolean option to `Yes`.

=item B<ReverseMagic>

Setting this option to `Yes`, makes Tinyproxy use a cookie to
track reverse proxy mappings. If you need to reverse proxy
sites which have absolute links you must use this option.

=item B<ReverseBaseURL>

The URL that is used to access this reverse proxy. The URL is
used to rewrite HTTP redirects so that they won't escape the
proxy. If you have a chain of reverse proxies, you'll need to
put the outermost URL here (the address which the end user
types into his/her browser).  If this option is not set then
no rewriting of redirects occurs.
