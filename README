Tinyproxy
=========

Tinyproxy is a small, efficient HTTP/SSL proxy daemon released under the
GNU General Public License.  Tinyproxy is very useful in a small network
setting, where a larger proxy would either be too resource intensive, or
a security risk.  One of the key features of Tinyproxy is the buffering
connection concept.  In effect, Tinyproxy will buffer a high speed
response from a server, and then relay it to a client at the highest
speed the client will accept.  This feature greatly reduces the problems
with sluggishness on the Internet.  If you are sharing an Internet
connection with a small network, and you only want to allow HTTP
requests to be allowed, then Tinyproxy is a great tool for the network
administrator.

Contributing
------------

If you would like to contribute a feature, or a bug fix to the Tinyproxy
source, please send a patch (preferably as a unified diff. i.e. `diff
-u` against the "master" branch of the Tinyproxy source code git
repository to tinyproxy-developers-list.  Please include a description
of what your patch does.

Tinyproxy's git repository is git://www.banu.com/tinyproxy.git. The
following command creates a local copy:

----
git clone git://www.banu.com/tinyproxy.git
----

The easiest and preferred way to create a patch for submission is to
check in your changes locally and use `git format-patch` to generate a
mbox-style commit file that contains the diff along with the commit
message and author information.  Such a format-patch file can be
integrated into the upstream repository, automatically keeping the
commit message and author information.

You can also meet developers and discuss development issues and patches
in the #tinyproxy IRC channel on Freenode (irc.freenode.net).
